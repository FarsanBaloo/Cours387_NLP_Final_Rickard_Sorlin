To achieve this, we set the vocabulary size to 50,304, which is slightly larger than needed but has many factors of&nbsp;2.

    "There is one important detail in the GPT-2 initialisation strategy that we have not addressed yet. [Radford et al. (2019)](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) write (Section&nbsp;2.3):\n",

    "> A modified initialization which accounts for the accumulation on the residual path with model depth is used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initialization by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{N}$ where $N$ is the number of residual layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this necessary? One of the challenges in training large language models is controlling the variance of activations. However, there are two points in the GPT architecture where variance can grow uncontrollably: the residual connections after the multi-head attention and the MLP. Since these connections simply add activations from previous layers, their variances increase with depth. To see this, note that if we sum $N$ independent normally distributed variables with variance $\\sigma^2$, the result has variance $N \\sigma^2$. The factor $1/\\sqrt{N}$ compensates for this growth."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step&nbsp;2.** Test the mathematical theory with a simulation. Generate normally distributed activations using `torch.randn()`. Sum the activations across $N$ hypothetical residual layers, first without scaling and then with the $1/\\sqrt{N}$ adjustment. Compare the two cases by producing a plot showing the variance at each layer. To compute the variance of a tensor, use `torch.var()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step&nbsp;3.** Update your model initialisation from the previous task to include the scaled residual initialisation. The adjustment should only be applied to the linear layer at the end of the multi-head attention and MLP blocks (`c_proj`). Note that a GPT model with $L$&nbsp;layers has $N = 2 L$ residual layers, because there are two residual connections in each layer (after the multi-head attention and the MLP)."

We have preprocessed the data by tokenising it with the GPT-2 tokeniser and storing the token indices in equal-sized NumPy arrays, which we call **shards**.

The number of bits assigned to the exponent determines the *range* of the representation, while the number of bits in the fraction determines the *precision*.\n",

As a result, modern hardware supports lower-precision formats that improve performance and memory efficiency while maintaining training stability. We are particularly interested in two of those:\n",

Unlike tf32, which is primarily used for internal computations, bf16 can be directly stored and used for activations, weights, and gradients, which can save memory (16 bits per value instead of 32)."

Theres also a 29.5% result from University of South Florda \"Abductive Reasoning for Unsupervised QA GPT-2\" that is close to our result. This diffrence in results comes likely from the data and its mix. The orginal GPT-2 was not trained on same dataset as our model that was trained on FineWeb-Edu. The data from FineWeb is propably more narrow and cleaner becuase of all filtration, so its clear that data quality and mix does a big diffrence, having clean and filted data is not enough even that it boost results a bit but isnt enough.\n",
