    "The code implements Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) by first converting text into UTF-8 bytes and treating each byte as a token. It then repeatedly merges adjacent token pairs according to previously learned merge rules until no more merges can be applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The merge rules are stored in self.merges, which has the type dict[Pair, int], where Pair is a tuple of two token IDs. A merge rule such as (a, b) > new_id means that the two consecutive tokens a and b can be replaced by the single token new_id. The dictionary self.vocab, with type dict[int, bytes], maps each token ID to the byte sequence it represents, which makes it possible to decode tokens back into text. \n",
    "\n",
    "During encoding, the tokenizer looks at all neighbouring token pairs in the current sequence and checks which of them also appear as merge rules in self.merges. If several merges are possible, it picks the pair whose merge value is smallest (using min()), which works like a priority so merges are applied in a fixed order. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if self.merges = {(4, 5): 2, (5, 6): 1} and the sequence is [4, 5, 6], both pairs can be merged. With min(), it merges (5, 6) first (because 1 is smaller) and gets [4, 1]. If we used max() instead, it would merge (4, 5) first (because 2 is larger) and get [2, 6]. This is why the code uses min(): it makes the merge order consistent."

    "The bag-of-words classifier first looks up an embedding vector for each token ID using the embedding layer.

This vector is passed through a linear layer to obtain the final classification scores. \n",

    "The code matches the lecture diagram in that each token is first mapped to a vector, and these vectors are then combined into a single representation before classification. However, unlike models that preserve word order, this classifier ignores the order of tokens and only uses their average. Because of this, only one embedding layer is needed, rather than multiple embeddings for different types of information. \n",
